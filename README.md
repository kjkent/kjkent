### Hi there, I'm Kris. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a full stack dev for [CyberSecuritiesUK](https://cybersecurities.uk), but as my contract is coming to an end, I'm open to new opportunities.
- ðŸŒ± I'm experienced with JS/Node, React, Express, Postgres, containerised workloads, as well as dev ops and infrastructure administration with Azure (including AAD), as well as maintaining Hyper-V and ESXi-based VMs.
- Also a huge linux nerd for RPM-based distros, and networking afficionado. I spend a lot of my time tinkering with microcontrollers.
- My greatest weakness? Soldering.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [kris@kjkent.dev](mailto:kris@kjkent.dev).
- âš¡ Fun fact: prior to working in tech, I was a science journalist, through which I travelled the world while talking to some of the best scientists on the planet â€” including three astronauts! Ive also worked on the frontlines of the North American opioid crisis.
